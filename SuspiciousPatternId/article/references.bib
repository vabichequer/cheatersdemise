abstract = {The low completion rate for Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), averaging 10 {\%} across total enrolment, highlights a need for close analysis of the underlying formative model. The methodology used here involves cooperation among MOOC participants to introduce new resources through social networks and the integration of these resources with previous teacher materials. The paper describes two MOOCs on distinct topics using this methodology and implemented on the same platform. The observed outcomes indicate increased completion rates for both courses as compared with other MOOCs developed on the same platform. Additionally, although participants in the two MOOCs differed in profile and personal goals, they reported similar perceptions of the quality of the learning experience, which was influenced by the knowledge management approach developed in the proposed methodology.},

abstract = {Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) open up learning opportunities to a large number of people. A
small percentage (around 10{\%}) of the large numbers of participants enrolling in MOOCs manage to finish the course
by completing all parts. The term ‘dropout' is commonly used to refer to ‘all who failed to complete' a course, and
is used in relation to MOOCs. Due to the nature of MOOCs, with students not paying enrolment and tuition fees,
there is no direct financial cost incurred by a student. Therefore it is debatable whether the traditional definition of
dropout in higher education could be directly applied to MOOCs. This paper reports ongoing exploratory work on
MOOC participants' perspectives based on six qualitative interviews. The findings show that MOOC participants are
challenging the widely held view of dropout, suggesting that it is more about failing to achieve their personal aims.},

abstract = {Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) are growing substantially in numbers, and also in interest from the educational community. MOOCs offer particular challenges for what is becoming accepted as mainstream practice in learning analytics. Partly for this reason, and partly because of the relative newness of MOOCs as a widespread phenomenon, there is not yet a substantial body of literature on the learning analytics of MOOCs. However, one clear finding is that drop-out/non-completion rates are substantially higher than in more traditional education. This paper explores these issues, and introduces the metaphor of a 'funnel of participation' to reconceptualise the steep drop-off in activity, and the pattern of steeply unequal participation, which appear to be characteristic of MOOCs and similar learning environments. Empirical data to support this funnel of participation are presented from three online learning sites: iSpot (observations of nature), Cloudworks ('a place to share, find and discuss learning and teaching ideas and experiences'), and openED 2.0, a MOOC on business and management that ran between 2010--2012. Implications of the funnel for MOOCs, formal education, and learning analytics practice are discussed.},

abstract = {Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have gained at- tention recently because of their great potential to reach learners. Substantial empirical study has focused on student persistence and their interactions with the course materials. However, most MOOCs include a rich textual dialogue fo- rum, and these textual interactions are largely unexplored. Automatically understanding the nature of discussion forum posts holds great promise for providing adaptive support to individual students and to collaborative groups. This paper presents a study that applies unsupervised student understanding models originally developed for synchronous tutorial dialogue to MOOC forums. We use a clustering approach to group similar posts, compare the clusters with manual annotations by MOOC researchers, and further in- vestigate clusters qualitatively. This paper constitutes a step toward applying unsupervised models to asynchronous communication, which can enable massive-scale automated discourse analysis and mining to better support students' learning.},

abstract = {The focus of this work is on developing a general method for identifying cheaters in MOOCs in a way that does not assume a particular method of cheating. For that, we develop a classification model that takes as input a set of features that operationalize performance and behavioral parameters that are known to be associated with cheating. These include students' ability, the level of interaction with the course resources, solving time, and Item Response Theory (IRT) person fit parameters. We start with a list of six candidate features, and after a feature selection process, remain with four. We use these to build a probabilistic classifier (logistic regression) that yields an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.826. Our data is based on an Introductory Physics MOOC. The features are computed using data-mining and standard IRT packages. We consider only the users who received a certificate in the course. Each of these users is considered as an example for the classifier. The positive examples are the set of users who were detected as "using multiple accounts to harvest solutions" by a different algorithm that was reported in a previous publication.},

abstract = {Massive open online courses (MOOCs) are now being used across the world to provide millions of learners with access to education. Many learners complete these courses successfully, or to their own satisfaction, but the high numbers who do not finish remain a subject of concern for platform providers and educators. In 2013, a team from Stanford University analysed engagement patterns on three MOOCs run on the Coursera platform. They found four distinct patterns of engagement that emerged from MOOCs based on videos and assessments. However, not all platforms take this approach to learning design. Courses on the FutureLearn platform are underpinned by a social-constructivist pedagogy, which includes discussion as an important element. In this paper, we analyse engagement patterns on four FutureLearn MOOCs and find that only two clusters identified previously apply in this case. Instead, we see seven distinct patterns of engagement: Samplers, Strong Starters, Returners, Mid-way Dropouts, Nearly There, Late Completers and Keen Completers. This suggests that patterns of engagement in these massive learning environments are influenced by decisions about pedagogy. We also make some observations about approaches to clustering in this context. Categories},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing AG 2017. When interacting with a MOOC, students can perform different kinds of actions such as watching videos, answering exercises, participating in the course forum, submitting a project or reviewing a document. These actions represent the dynamism of student learning paths, and their preferences when learning in an autonomous mode. In this paper we propose to analyse these learning paths with two goals in mind. The first one is to try to discover the different roles that students may adopt when interacting with an online course. By applying k-means, six of these roles are discovered and we give a qualitative interpretation of them based on student information associated to each cluster. The other goal is to predict academic performance. In this sense, we present the results obtained with Random Forest and Neural Networks that allow us to predict the final grade with around 10{\%} of mean absolute error.},

In previous research we developed an algorithm to identify and label submissions that were cheated using the CAMEO method; this algorithm relied on the IP of the submissions. In this study we use this tagged sample of submissions to i) compare the influence of student and problems characteristics on CAMEO and ii) build a random forest classifier that detects submissions as CAMEO without relying on IP, achieving sensitivity and specificity levels of 0.966 and 0.996, respectively. Finally, we analyze the importance of the different features of the model finding that student features are the most important variables towards the correct classification of CAMEO submissions, concluding also that student features have more influence on CAMEO than problem features.},

The strategy, Copying Answers using Multiple Existences Online (CAMEO), involves a user who gathers solutions to assessment questions using a "harvester" account and then submits correct answers using a separate "master" account. We use a small-scale experiment to verify CAMEO and estimate a "lower bound" for its prevalence among 1.9 million course participants in 115 MOOCs from two universities. Using conservative thresholds, we estimate CAMEO prevalence at 1237 certificates, accounting for 1.3{\%} of the certificates in the 69 MOOCs with CAMEO users. Among earners of 20 or more certificates, 25{\%} have used the CAMEO strategy. CAMEO users are more likely to be young, male, and international than other MOOC certificate earners. We identify preventive strategies that can decrease CAMEO rates and show evidence of their effectiveness in science courses.},
