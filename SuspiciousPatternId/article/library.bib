   abstract = {After a stroke, a limb may present motor deficits that lead to daily activities limitation and functional disabilities, restricting the patient’s social interaction, leading to insolation and even depression due the inability to perform basic tasks. One of the means of treatment for this deficit is the mirror therapy that seeks the activation of neural networks through an optical illusion between a good and an affected limb. This work presents a technological approach for the mirror therapy application. Here we propose, explain and discuss the use of augmented reality as mirror therapy in the stroke treatment. Using a smart phone camera we replace a compromised member by a virtual that makes specific movements. In this way, we seek to create an efficient therapeutic tool that is easily accessible through a cellular device, providing resource for the practice of this therapy and speeding up the motor and functional recovery of patients.},

   abstract = {© Springer International Publishing AG 2017. When interacting with a MOOC, students can perform different kinds of actions such as watching videos, answering exercises, participating in the course forum, submitting a project or reviewing a document. These actions represent the dynamism of student learning paths, and their preferences when learning in an autonomous mode. In this paper we propose to analyse these learning paths with two goals in mind. The first one is to try to discover the different roles that students may adopt when interacting with an online course. By applying k-means, six of these roles are discovered and we give a qualitative interpretation of them based on student information associated to each cluster. The other goal is to predict academic performance. In this sense, we present the results obtained with Random Forest and Neural Networks that allow us to predict the final grade with around 10% of mean absolute error.},

This paper analyzes the main features of current e-learning systems, pointing out their sources of data and the huge amount of information that may be retrieved from them. Moreover, we assess the concept of educational Big Data, suggesting a logical and functional layered model that can turn to be very useful in real life.},

   abstract = {© Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2001. In the paper nine different approaches to missing attribute values are presented and compared. Ten input data files were used to investigate the performance of the nine methods to deal with missing attribute values. For testing both naive classification and new classification techniques of LERS (Learning from Examples based on Rough Sets) were used. The quality criterion was the average error rate achieved by ten-fold cross-validation. Using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test, we conclude that the C4.5 approach and the method of ignoring examples with missing attribute values are the best methods among all nine approaches; the most common attribute-value method is the worst method among all nine approaches; while some methods do not differ from other methods significantly. The method of assigning to the missing attribute value all possible values of the attribute and the method of assigning to the missing attribute value all possible values of the attribute restricted to the same concept are excellent approaches based on our limited experimental results. However we do not have enough evidence to support the claim that these approaches are superior.},

   abstract = {One relevant problem in data quality is missing data. Despite the frequent occurrence and the relevance of the missing data problem, many machine learning algorithms handle missing data in a rather naive way. However, missing data treatment should be carefully treated, otherwise bias might be introduced into the knowledge induced. In this work, we analyze the use of the k-nearest neighbor as an imputation method. Imputation is a term that denotes a procedure that replaces the missing values in a data set with some plausible values. One advantage of this approach is that the missing data treatment is independent of the learning algorithm used. This allows the user to select the most suitable imputation method for each situation. Our analysis indicates that missing data imputation based on the k-nearest neighbor algorithm can outperform the internal methods used by C4.5 and CN2 to treat missing data, and can also outperform the mean or mode imputation method, which is a method broadly used to treat missing values.},

American Statistical Association is collaborating with JSTOR to digitize, preserve and extend access to Journal of the American Statistical Association. A common concern when faced with multivariate data with missing values is whether the missing data are missing completely at random (MCAR); that is, whether missingness depends on the variables in the data set. One way of assessing this is to compare the means of recorded values of each variable between groups defined by whether other variables in the data set are missing or not. Although informative, this procedure yields potentially many correlated statistics for testing MCAR, resulting in multiple-comparison problems. This article proposes a single global test statistic for MCAR that uses all of the available data. The asymptotic null distribution is given, and the small-sample null distribution is derived for multivariate normal data with a monotone pattern of missing data. The test reduces to a standard t test when the data are bivariate with missing data confined to a single variable. A limited simulation study of empirical sizes for the test applied to normal and nonnormal data suggests that the test is conservative for small samples.},

We use a small-scale experiment to verify CAMEO and estimate a "lower bound" for its prevalence among 1.9 million course participants in 115 MOOCs from two universities. Using conservative thresholds, we estimate CAMEO prevalence at 1237 certificates, accounting for 1.3% of the certificates in the 69 MOOCs with CAMEO users. Among earners of 20 or more certificates, 25% have used the CAMEO strategy. CAMEO users are more likely to be young, male, and international than other MOOC certificate earners. We identify preventive strategies that can decrease CAMEO rates and show evidence of their effectiveness in science courses.},

In this study we use this tagged sample of submissions to i) compare the influence of student and problems characteristics on CAMEO and ii) build a random forest classifier that detects submissions as CAMEO without relying on IP, achieving sensitivity and specificity levels of 0.966 and 0.996, respectively.

   abstract = {Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) are growing substantially in numbers, and also in interest from the educational community. MOOCs offer particular challenges for what is becoming accepted as mainstream practice in learning analytics. Partly for this reason, and partly because of the relative newness of MOOCs as a widespread phenomenon, there is not yet a substantial body of literature on the learning analytics of MOOCs. However, one clear finding is that drop-out/non-completion rates are substantially higher than in more traditional education. This paper explores these issues, and introduces the metaphor of a 'funnel of participation' to reconceptualise the steep drop-off in activity, and the pattern of steeply unequal participation, which appear to be characteristic of MOOCs and similar learning environments. Empirical data to support this funnel of participation are presented from three online learning sites: iSpot (observations of nature), Cloudworks ('a place to share, find and discuss learning and teaching ideas and experiences'), and openED 2.0, a MOOC on business and management that ran between 2010--2012. Implications of the funnel for MOOCs, formal education, and learning analytics practice are discussed.},

there is no direct financial cost incurred by a student. Therefore it is debatable whether the traditional definition of
dropout in higher education could be directly applied to MOOCs. This paper reports ongoing exploratory work on

The operations can be performed using two augmented reality cubes, which can obtain up to 6 degrees of freedom, and every user can select any operation by using a button on the keyboard to cycle through them. To the cubes are assigned two different points of view: an exocentric view, where the user will stand at a given distance from the object, with a point of view similar to the one of a human being; and an egocentric view, where the user will stand much closer to the object, having the point of view from the object's perspective. These points of view are locked to each user, which means that one user cannot use both views, just the one assigned to his ID. The cameras have a small margin of movement, allowing just a tilt to the sides, according to the Oculus's movements.

The MC divides all learners into three groups including certification earning, video watching, and course sampling. The GC then predicts a certification earning learner may or may not obtain a certification.
