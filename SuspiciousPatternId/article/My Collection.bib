abstract = {Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have gained at- tention recently because of their great potential to reach learners. Substantial empirical study has focused on student persistence and their interactions with the course materials. However, most MOOCs include a rich textual dialogue fo- rum, and these textual interactions are largely unexplored. Automatically understanding the nature of discussion forum posts holds great promise for providing adaptive support to individual students and to collaborative groups. This paper presents a study that applies unsupervised student understanding models originally developed for synchronous tutorial dialogue to MOOC forums. We use a clustering approach to group similar posts, compare the clusters with manual annotations by MOOC researchers, and further in- vestigate clusters qualitatively. This paper constitutes a step toward applying unsupervised models to asynchronous communication, which can enable massive-scale automated discourse analysis and mining to better support students' learning.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing AG 2017.The growing development of virtual learning platforms is boosting a new type of Big Data and of Big Data Stream, those ones that can be labeled as e-learning Big Data. These data, coming from different sources of Virtual Learning Environments, such as communications between students and instructors as well as pupils tests, require accurate analysis and mining techniques in order to retrieve from them fruitful insights. This paper analyzes the main features of current e-learning systems, pointing out their sources of data and the huge amount of information that may be retrieved from them. Moreover, we assess the concept of educational Big Data, suggesting a logical and functional layered model that can turn to be very useful in real life.},

abstract = {Massive open online courses (MOOCs) are now being used across the world to provide millions of learners with access to education. Many learners complete these courses successfully, or to their own satisfaction, but the high numbers who do not finish remain a subject of concern for platform providers and educators. In 2013, a team from Stanford University analysed engagement patterns on three MOOCs run on the Coursera platform. They found four distinct patterns of engagement that emerged from MOOCs based on videos and assessments. However, not all platforms take this approach to learning design. Courses on the FutureLearn platform are underpinned by a social-constructivist pedagogy, which includes discussion as an important element. In this paper, we analyse engagement patterns on four FutureLearn MOOCs and find that only two clusters identified previously apply in this case. Instead, we see seven distinct patterns of engagement: Samplers, Strong Starters, Returners, Mid-way Dropouts, Nearly There, Late Completers and Keen Completers. This suggests that patterns of engagement in these massive learning environments are influenced by decisions about pedagogy. We also make some observations about approaches to clustering in this context. Categories},

@inproceedings{Perez-Lemonche2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing AG 2017. When interacting with a MOOC, students can perform different kinds of actions such as watching videos, answering exercises, participating in the course forum, submitting a project or reviewing a document. These actions represent the dynamism of student learning paths, and their preferences when learning in an autonomous mode. In this paper we propose to analyse these learning paths with two goals in mind. The first one is to try to discover the different roles that students may adopt when interacting with an online course. By applying k-means, six of these roles are discovered and we give a qualitative interpretation of them based on student information associated to each cluster. The other goal is to predict academic performance. In this sense, we present the results obtained with Random Forest and Neural Networks that allow us to predict the final grade with around 10{\%} of mean absolute error.},
